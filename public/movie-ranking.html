<h1>Top Movie pick's By Ricky</h1>

<h2>3 great Family Movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Harry Potter Franchise</h3>

<p>No matter the time of year I can always find myself going back to the beloved film based on the novels by J.K. Rowling.
whether it be the first 2 movies that are colourful and open your eyes to the wizarding world or the later installments
that become more dark and sinister as the dark magic comes into play, these are agreat watch for all</p>

<h3>DragonBall Z Battle of the Gods</h3>

<p>Now if you are like me and enjoy a little anime from time to time, this movie is a great choice which ties in the 1st series
of DragonBall Super into a more action packed and beutifully drawn piece of anime.</p>

<h3>The Grinch</h3>

<p>Yet again another great film to watch no matter the time of year, this is Jim Carry at his finest with funny spins and turns
in this wonderfully re-imagining of the all time classic book</p>
